State of the art Agri Tech solution to modernise Agricultural marketing

Problem Statement:
Agricultural marketing still continues to be in a bad shape in rural India. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price.

In most cases, these farmers are forced, under socio-economic conditions, to carry on distress sale of their produce. In most of small villages, the farmers sell their produce to the money lender from whom they usually borrow money.

Solution:
Online portal catering to the local population of a geographical region.
  Components of the Portal:
    1) Database having information about current storage capacities, segments of Agriculture produce being stored, Price information.
    2) Vendor & Buyer information
    3) real time record updation
    4) Analytic graphs would be generated to showcase when, where and how to sell the produce?
    5) farmers would be alerted throgh SMS, whenever the market demang incraeses for there goods.
    6) Market would be notified when the crop is ready to be sold.
    7) real time settlements to be made.
    8) Open & transparent system, which can be accessed by all users thus removing malpractices.
    
  Tech parts of the solution:
    1) Data collected from farmers through SMS.
    2) Weather data through raspberry-pi
    3) Crop data collected from farmers.
    4) Market trends and data collected from Govt sites.
    5) SQL pool craeted.
    6) datawarehouse- Azure Synapse Analytics
    7) Analytics to be performed on Azure Databrics.
    8) reports prepared on Power BI.
    
We strongly believe, if we can created a transparent and real time Agricultural Market then it will resolve most of the farmer's distress that we are witnessing at current time in India.

Looking forward to developing this solution
